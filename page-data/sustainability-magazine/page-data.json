Chances are you have seen these symbols on products, and while they look like the “recycling symbol”, they actually indicate resin type, with some representing material that is not recyclable at all.\n<br /><br/>\n<strong>Number 1:</strong> PETE (or PET) – Polyethylene Terephthalate\nOne of the most common types of plastic you are likely to come across – this is the resin used for the manufacture of products such as food containers and plastic bottles for water or soft drinks. PETE (sometimes referred to as PET) is widely recycled.\n<br /><br/>\n<strong>Number 2:</strong> HDPE – High-Density Polyethylene\nMore rigid than PETE, this type of plastic is used in what will appear to be “sturdier” products such as detergent bottles, food and drink storage, bottle caps, some thicker shopping bags, and non-single-use plastic products like toys, helmets, and piping. Again, this type of plastic is widely recycled.\n<br /><br/>\n<strong>Number 3:</strong> PVC – Polyvinyl Chloride\nPVC is considered one of the most versatile and common plastic types and is used for applications such as water and waste pipes (due to it being very resistant to chemical and biological damage), flooring, signage, furniture, and more. While there are some methods developed to recycle PVC, it is not common and rarely found in general plastic collections. This is in large part due to the toxicity of PVC when processed.\n<br /><br/>\n<strong>Number 4:</strong> LDPE – Low-Density Polyethylene\nWhile not as strong as HDPE, this low-density plastic is highly resilient and used across a wide range of products such as containers, playground fixtures, and plastic trash bags. This resin-type is recyclable, but many products can be excluded (such as plastic bags) since they pose the risk of clogging machinery and are deemed not worthwhile to recycle.\n<br /><br/>\n<strong>Number 5:</strong> PP – Polypropylene\nCommonly used in injection molding, this plastic can be found in products from bottle caps to surgical tools and clothing. While PP is recyclable, it is often rejected by processing centers due to the problems it poses, making the rate at which it is recycled far lower than other plastics.\n<br /><br/>\n<strong>Number 6:</strong> PS – Polystyrene\nThis plastic is frequently used as disposable plastic containers for food, as insulated containers, and in packaging materials. Despite its abundance, PS is rarely recycled due to it not being cost-effective (in its most common form, expanded polystyrene or styrofoam, is 95% air) and requires more energy than it saves to recycle.\n<br /><br/>\n<strong>Number 7:</strong> Other\nThis category encompasses everything else, which can include combinations of any of the previous six as well as other lesser-used plastics. This classification also includes non-petrochemical plastics such as new plastics, polymers, and bioplastics. As such, anything marked with a number 7 is generally not included in the plastic recycling process but may have other waste solutions.\n<br /><br/>\nAs it stands today, the plastics recycling process faces many challenges, and unlike glass and aluminum, plastics are not infinitely recyclable, meaning that with each subsequent processing, the recycled material degrades and is a lesser quality than virgin materials.\n<br /><br/>\nHowever, don’t miss the broader perspective. Today’s recycling process for plastic is leagues ahead of what it was just a few decades ago, with recycling rates growing, and continuing to grow, significantly. Innovations like chemical recycling are occurring to keep more plastics in the recycling loop for longer. What’s more, there are a growing number of alternatives to plastic items hitting the market.\n<br /><br/>\nAs individuals and businesses increasingly engage with the plastic recycling process, we are likely to see it continue to improve. Along with the shift towards new products and plastic alternatives, this signifies a slow but steady movement in the right direction.\n<br /><br/>\nThe plastic recycling process is likely to receive a huge boost as we become more conscientious in the way we use resources and manufacture products. In fact, while waste management concepts such as the circular economy and zero waste are broadly aligned with a move away from single-use plastics, recycling will remain a part of the waste management process for the foreseeable future, allowing us to gradually move away from unnecessary plastics and increase the recyclability of those that remain necessary.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Different types of plastics","date":"February 27, 2021","description":"There are numerous types of plastic, and when trying to familiarize yourself with the plastic recycling process and avoid contamination, there are seven categories to remember.","author":"Margareth Lindström","thumbnailImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5202702702702702,"src":"/ricola-gatsby/static/b89ef287f065d4c8eb89969aad8962df/db955/plastic.png","srcSet":"/ricola-gatsby/static/b89ef287f065d4c8eb89969aad8962df/7e7e9/plastic.png 225w,\n/ricola-gatsby/static/b89ef287f065d4c8eb89969aad8962df/62b1f/plastic.png 450w,\n/ricola-gatsby/static/b89ef287f065d4c8eb89969aad8962df/db955/plastic.png 900w,\n/ricola-gatsby/static/b89ef287f065d4c8eb89969aad8962df/40363/plastic.png 1054w","sizes":"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"}}}}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/knowledge-3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How long does it take to dissolve plastic"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/test-article/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The relationship between nature and human"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"909eb5e8-1e90-57af-b505-864bb0bd71c8","previousPostId":"10cc3641-0670-556b-85a5-5905cbe9d3f6","nextPostId":"e5099988-857f-55b9-8296-26b96deda084"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
